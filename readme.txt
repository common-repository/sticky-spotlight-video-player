<h3>Key Features:</h3>

This plugin offers much more than just embedding videos from your favorite video sharing sites. It offers really cool features for video marketers. Following are some features that proves this plugin is different from other plugins available:

- Your video will float along the left or right side of the browser window as the reader scrolls the content, so both the video and your marketing message stays in focus. 

- With our exclusive call to action box added to the bottom of the video container, you can keep your offer in front of visitors as they read through your entire site. Once they are hooked, the call to action is right there to help them convert.

- We know it's important to keep a great user experience on your site, so we also allow users to minimize or close the floating video.
